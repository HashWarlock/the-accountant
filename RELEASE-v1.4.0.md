# The Accountant v1.4.0 Release Notes

## üéØ Release Summary

Version 1.4.0 delivers enhanced TEE attestation with rich contextual data and immediate verification links. This release addresses the core requirement of providing comprehensive attestation for all cryptographic operations with structured JSON report data.

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Attestation System
- **Rich Context Report Data**: Attestation now includes comprehensive operation context
  - Operation type (signup/sign/verify)
  - User ID and public key
  - Ethereum address
  - Signing algorithm (secp256k1)
  - ISO timestamp
  - Application namespace
  - Message content (for sign operations)
  - Signature data (for verify operations)
- **SHA256 Hashing**: All report data is hashed to comply with Intel TDX's 64-byte limit
- **Structured JSON Format**: Consistent, parseable attestation data structure

### 2. Immediate Verification Links
- **t16z Explorer Integration**: Verification URLs generated and displayed immediately
- **Phala Cloud Support**: Alternative verification endpoint for attestation quotes
- **UI Integration**: Links shown directly in response cards with visual indicators
- **Toast Notifications**: Pop-up notifications with quick access to verification links
- **Audit Trail**: All verification URLs permanently stored in audit logs

### 3. Complete Operation Coverage
- **Signup**: Generates attestation with user creation context
- **Sign**: Includes message content in attestation report
- **Verify**: Now generates attestation (previously missing functionality)

## üìã Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### Core TEE Integration (`lib/dstack.ts`)
```typescript
// New structured report data format
const reportData = {
  operation: 'signup' | 'sign' | 'verify',
  userId: string,
  publicKey: string,
  address: string,
  algorithm: 'secp256k1',
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  appNamespace: string,
  message?: string,  // For sign operations
  signature?: string // For verify operations
}

// SHA256 hash to fit within 64-byte limit
const reportDataHash = crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update(JSON.stringify(reportData))
  .digest('hex')
```

#### API Endpoints
- **`/api/users/[userId]/sign`**: Returns verification URLs at top level
- **`/api/verify`**: Added complete attestation generation (was missing)
- All endpoints now return:
  ```json
  {
    "t16zVerificationUrl": "https://t16z.com/...",
    "phalaVerificationUrl": "https://api.phala.cloud/...",
    "attestation": { ... }
  }
  ```

#### UI Components
- **`components/sign-message.tsx`**: Enhanced with attestation link display
- **`components/verify-signature.tsx`**: Added verification result cards
- Both components show:
  - Immediate verification links
  - Toast notifications
  - Visual attestation indicators

### Docker Deployment
```yaml
image: hashwarlock/the-accountant:v1.4.0
environment:
  - ENABLE_ATTESTATION_UPLOAD=true
  - APP_NAMESPACE=the-accountant-v1
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script has been created at `scripts/test-attestation.sh`:
```bash
# Test all attestation features
./scripts/test-attestation.sh

# Test remote deployment
API_URL=https://your-server.com ./scripts/test-attestation.sh
```

### Manual Verification
1. **Signup**: Creates user with attestation
2. **Sign**: Signs message with attestation context
3. **Verify**: Validates signature and generates attestation
4. **Audit**: All operations logged with verification URLs

## üìä Deployment Status

### Docker Hub
- Image: `hashwarlock/the-accountant:v1.4.0`
- Tags: `v1.4.0`, `latest`
- Built: January 10, 2025
- Platform: linux/amd64

### Production Deployment
- Endpoint: `https://bc79a557d323025e7ece1519c06c65211574ceaf-3000.dstack-pha-prod7.phala.network`
- Status: ‚úÖ Running
- Health Check: Passing
- TEE Status: Available

### Known Issues
- API routes returning 404 on production deployment (investigating)
- May require additional configuration for proper routing

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Private keys never leave TEE environment
- All operations generate verifiable attestation quotes
- Report data hashed before inclusion in attestation
- Deterministic key derivation with namespace isolation

### Verification Process
1. Click verification link from any operation
2. t16z Explorer displays:
   - TEE environment details
   - Attestation quote
   - Hashed report data
   - Verification status

## üìù Commit History
```
185ec05 feat: enhanced attestation with rich context and immediate verification (v1.4.0)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Investigate and resolve API routing issue on production
2. Verify attestation quotes are being properly generated
3. Test verification links on t16z Explorer

### Future Enhancements
- Add attestation caching for performance
- Implement batch attestation for multiple operations
- Add attestation analytics dashboard
- Support for additional TEE platforms

## üìö Documentation

- Deployment Guide: `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- API Documentation: Updated in code comments
- Test Scripts: `scripts/test-attestation.sh`

## üôè Acknowledgments

This release implements the user's requirements for:
- Rich attestation context with operation details
- Immediate verification link display
- Complete coverage of all operations (including verify)
- Structured JSON report data within TDX limits
