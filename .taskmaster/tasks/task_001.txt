# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Next.js Project with Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Next.js 15+ project with App Router and install required dependencies with security patches
# Details:
Initialize Next.js 15.2.3+ project using create-next-app with App Router to avoid CVE-2025-29927 vulnerability. Install dependencies with pinned secure versions: @phala/dstack-sdk, prisma@6.11.1+, @prisma/client, @noble/curves@3.0.0, js-sha3@0.9.3 (instead of sha3), viem@2.0+, zod for validation, and dev dependencies including TypeScript, ESLint. Pin exact versions in package.json to ensure security compliance. Configure package.json scripts for build, dev, start, and database operations. Set up proper TypeScript configuration and Next.js configuration file (next.config.mjs) with proper security headers. CRITICAL: Use Next.js 15.2.3+ or 14.2.25+ minimum to avoid security vulnerability.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project initializes correctly with secure Next.js version, all dependencies install without conflicts and security warnings, TypeScript compilation works, development server starts successfully, and security audit passes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Next.js project with secure version [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Next.js project using version 15.2.3+ to avoid CVE-2025-29927
### Details:
Run create-next-app with Next.js 15.2.3+ (or 14.2.25+ minimum) to avoid CVE-2025-29927 vulnerability. Use App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Verify the installed Next.js version meets security requirements before proceeding.

## 2. Install and pin secure dependency versions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install all required dependencies with exact secure versions pinned in package.json
### Details:
Install dependencies with exact pinned versions: @noble/curves@3.0.0, js-sha3@0.9.3, viem@^2.0.0, prisma@^6.11.1, @prisma/client@^6.11.1, @phala/dstack-sdk@latest, zod@latest. Use exact versions where specified for security. Verify no security vulnerabilities in dependency tree.

## 3. Configure package.json scripts and project settings [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up development, build, and database scripts with proper configuration
### Details:
Configure package.json scripts for build, dev, start, and database operations (db:generate, db:migrate, db:studio). Set up proper TypeScript configuration with strict mode. Configure Next.js configuration file (next.config.mjs) with security headers including Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers.

## 4. Verify security compliance and dependency audit [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run security audits and verify all dependencies meet security requirements
### Details:
Run npm audit to ensure no security vulnerabilities. Verify Next.js version is 15.2.3+ or 14.2.25+. Check that @noble/curves is 3.0.0, js-sha3 is 0.9.3, viem is 2.0+, and Prisma is 6.11.1+. Document security compliance in project README.
