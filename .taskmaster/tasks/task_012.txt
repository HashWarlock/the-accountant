# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Deployment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Docker, docker-compose, and CVM deployment artifacts
# Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfile for production builds with Node.js 20 Alpine base, optimized layer caching, security hardening, and health checks. Create docker-compose.yml with web service configuration, dstack socket volume mount (/var/run/dstack.sock), security options, resource limits, and health checks. Create app-compose.json for Phala CVM deployment with proper security attestation, socket mounting, capability dropping, and routing configuration. Add .dockerignore for build optimization. Include comprehensive README with local and CVM deployment instructions.

# Test Strategy:
Docker build verification, container security scanning, health check functionality, socket mounting tests, and deployment documentation validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Multi-stage Dockerfile [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build production-optimized Dockerfile with Node.js 20 Alpine base
### Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfile with builder stage for dependencies and production stage. Use Node.js 20 Alpine base image, implement layer caching optimization, include security hardening measures (non-root user, minimal packages), and add health check configuration.

## 2. Configure docker-compose.yml [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Set up Docker Compose configuration with service definitions
### Details:
Create docker-compose.yml with web service configuration, dstack socket volume mount (/var/run/dstack.sock), security options, resource limits, and health checks. Include environment variable configuration and proper networking setup.

## 3. Create Phala CVM app-compose.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Build CVM-specific deployment configuration
### Details:
Create app-compose.json for Phala CVM deployment with security attestation, socket mounting configuration, capability dropping for security hardening, and proper routing configuration for CVM environment.

## 4. Implement Security Hardening Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Apply security configurations across all deployment files
### Details:
Implement security hardening including non-root user configuration, capability dropping, security context settings, read-only root filesystem where applicable, and proper secret management practices.

## 5. Configure Health Check Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Set up health check endpoints and monitoring
### Details:
Configure comprehensive health checks for Docker and CVM deployments, including application health endpoints, dependency checks, and proper timeout/retry configurations.

## 6. Create .dockerignore Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Optimize Docker build context with .dockerignore
### Details:
Create .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context, reducing build time and image size. Include node_modules, .git, logs, and development-only files.

## 7. Write Deployment Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4, 12.5, 12.6
### Description: Create comprehensive deployment README and documentation
### Details:
Create detailed deployment documentation including local Docker setup instructions, CVM deployment guide, environment variable configuration, troubleshooting guide, and security considerations.
