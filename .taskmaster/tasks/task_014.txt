# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement dstack SDK Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create proper dstack client wrapper for TEE-based key management and signing
# Details:
Create lib/dstack.ts wrapper that uses @phala/dstack-sdk for all cryptographic operations. The SDK provides complete key management internally:
- Use client.getKey('wallet/ethereum', userId) to get deterministic wallet keys
- The SDK returns complete key objects with signing capabilities built-in
- All crypto operations happen inside the TEE
- Connect via Unix socket at /var/run/dstack.sock
- Implement proper error handling for TEE connection issues
- Add fallback for local development without TEE

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with mock TEE, connection handling tests, key derivation consistency tests
