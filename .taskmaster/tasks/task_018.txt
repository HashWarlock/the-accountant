# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement remote attestation quote generation for key access
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add TEE remote attestation quotes whenever a key is accessed or generated
# Details:
Implement functionality to generate a remote attestation quote from the TEE (dstack) every time a user's key is accessed. This includes key generation during signup and key retrieval during signing operations. The quote should include the public key/address in the application data field for cryptographic proof of key access within the TEE.

# Test Strategy:
Test quote generation during signup, signing, and verification operations. Verify quotes contain correct application data. Test quote format and attestation chain validity.
