# Task ID: 15
# Title: Test Docker Image Build
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify the Docker image builds successfully and is production-ready
# Details:
Build the Docker image using the multi-stage Dockerfile to ensure all stages complete successfully. Verify standalone Next.js output generation, dependency installation, Prisma client generation, non-root user setup, and health check configuration. Test image size optimization and layer caching.

# Test Strategy:
Run docker build command, verify build completes without errors, check image size is under 500MB, test container startup, verify health endpoint responds correctly
