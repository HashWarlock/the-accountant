# Title: Redesign Secure Wallet UI for Modern Look
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the Secure Wallet Infrastructure interface to have a more modern and sleek appearance
# Details:
The current UI has rigid, boxy elements that need modernization:
1. Navigation tabs - Replace rigid boxes with fluid, modern tab design
2. Form inputs - Add proper styling, shadows, focus states, and transitions
3. Button design - Improve the Sign Message button with modern styling
4. Layout improvements - Add better spacing, reduce rigidity, implement card-based design
5. Color scheme - Replace lime green background with sophisticated color palette
6. Typography - Improve font choices, sizes, and text hierarchy
7. Add subtle animations and transitions for better UX

# Test Strategy:
Visual testing to ensure UI updates render correctly across different screen sizes and browsers
