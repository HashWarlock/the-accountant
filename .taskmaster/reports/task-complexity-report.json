		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js initialization into discrete setup steps: project creation, dependency installation, configuration files setup, and verification. Each subtask should be independently verifiable.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward project initialization with well-documented tools. Most complexity comes from ensuring all dependencies are compatible and properly configured."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Prisma Database Schema and Setup",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate Prisma setup into: schema definition, database configuration, client generation, migration creation, and environment setup. Include validation steps for each component.",
			"reasoning": "Prisma setup involves multiple interconnected steps. Schema design is straightforward but requires proper database configuration, migration handling, and environment variable management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cryptographic Utilities",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into individual crypto functions: key conversion utilities, Ethereum address derivation, message signing implementation, signature verification, error handling, and comprehensive testing with known vectors.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to cryptographic precision requirements. Each function must handle edge cases correctly, use proper libraries, and maintain security standards. Testing requires known test vectors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate dstack SDK",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: SDK wrapper creation, socket connection handling, key derivation implementation, error handling for connection failures, memory safety measures, health check functionality, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to external dependency on dstack socket, memory security requirements, and need for robust error handling. Integration with external services adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Signup API",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: API route setup, request validation with Zod, dstack integration for key generation, database operations with Prisma, error handling and response formatting, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity combining multiple systems (dstack, crypto, database). Requires careful orchestration of key generation, data validation, and persistence while maintaining security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Keys API",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: API route creation, input validation, database query implementation, and error handling for edge cases. Include basic security measures.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively simple CRUD operation with database lookup. Main complexity is proper validation and error handling for non-existent users."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Signing API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: API route setup, parameter validation, dstack key retrieval, message signing implementation, memory safety for private keys, and performance optimization with monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security requirements, performance constraints (50ms p95), and need to handle private keys safely. Combines dstack integration with crypto operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Signature Verification API",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: API route creation, input validation with Zod, signature verification logic using crypto utilities, and comprehensive testing with edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focusing on proper validation and crypto operations. No external dependencies like dstack, making it more straightforward than signing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Users API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: basic API route setup, database query with Prisma, pagination implementation, sorting and filtering features, and performance optimization for large datasets.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to performance requirements (10k users, 200ms p95) and need for pagination, sorting, and filtering. Database optimization is key."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Health Check API",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: basic health endpoint setup, database connectivity checking, dstack socket availability testing, and comprehensive error handling with timeout management.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring integration with multiple systems (database, dstack socket). Health checks need to be robust and handle various failure scenarios gracefully."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Build User Interface Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into individual components: signup form component, user dashboard component, admin dashboard component, API integration layer, form validation, error handling, responsive design implementation, and user interaction testing.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multiple React components, API integrations, form handling, and responsive design requirements. Each component has different complexity levels."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Create Deployment Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: Dockerfile creation with multi-stage build, docker-compose.yml configuration, Phala CVM app-compose.json setup, security hardening measures, health check configuration, .dockerignore optimization, and comprehensive deployment documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multiple deployment targets (Docker, CVM), security requirements, and need for proper socket mounting. CVM-specific configuration adds specialized knowledge requirements."
