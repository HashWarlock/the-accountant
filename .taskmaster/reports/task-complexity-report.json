			"taskTitle": "Implement remote attestation quote generation for key access",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into: 1) Integrate quote generation into signup flow, 2) Add quote generation to signing operations, 3) Modify dstack wrapper to include application data with public key/address, 4) Handle quote generation errors and fallbacks, 5) Add comprehensive logging and monitoring for quote operations",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. The generateAttestationQuote function already exists in lib/dstack.ts, but needs integration into multiple API endpoints (signup, sign). Requires modifying existing flows to include quote generation and proper application data formatting."

			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Create audit log system for key access events",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into: 1) Design and implement audit log database schema (migration), 2) Create audit log data models and types, 3) Implement audit logging service/utilities, 4) Add audit log creation to signup API, 5) Add audit log creation to signing API, 6) Create audit log query API endpoints with pagination and filtering",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Requires database schema changes, new Prisma models, service layer implementation, and integration into existing APIs. The current schema only has User model, so this adds significant database and API complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Add quote verification endpoint and UI",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into: 1) Research and implement Intel/AMD attestation verification libraries, 2) Create quote verification API endpoint with proper validation, 3) Design UI components for quote display and verification status, 4) Implement quote parsing and detail extraction, 5) Add verification result visualization, 6) Handle different TEE types (Intel SGX vs AMD SEV), 7) Add comprehensive error handling for malformed quotes",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Requires external attestation service integration, complex cryptographic verification, new UI components, and handling multiple TEE architectures. This involves both backend verification logic and frontend display components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Add attestation quote to API responses",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into: 1) Modify signup API response to include attestation quote, 2) Update signing API response to include quote data, 3) Ensure backward compatibility with existing API clients, 4) Update API documentation and response schemas to include quote fields",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Involves modifying existing API endpoints that are already implemented. The quote generation is available, but needs integration into response structures and proper encoding. Backward compatibility consideration adds some complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Create audit log viewer UI component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into: 1) Create audit log data fetching and API integration, 2) Design and implement audit log table/list component, 3) Add filtering and search functionality, 4) Implement quote display with hex viewer and copy functionality, 5) Add export functionality (JSON/CSV) with proper data formatting",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Requires new UI components, data management, filtering/search logic, and export functionality. The current codebase appears to be primarily API-focused with minimal UI, so this adds significant frontend complexity."
